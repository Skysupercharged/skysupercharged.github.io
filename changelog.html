The Temporary Webring Update

i'm up way too late
veyr minor update to the main page that above all else adds the long awaited stellaring buttons,
because it's been an entire year since i last updated the site (i promise i'm not dead) and i've been infamously
killing the loop for a while now.
also adds the updated favicon and some updated stylesheets</pre>

The... Update

just kinda some miscellaneous changes. the index page got updated, images with links no longer have the hitbox for their links stretch across the entire page.
the 404 page should now exist even if you go to something totally invalid like <a href="https://skysupercharged.github.io/example/example">https://skysupercharged.github.io/example/example</a>. maybe. at the cost of skamton no longer using the old 404.
the old 404 will be put somewhere in skamton's part of the site as it's own page</pre>

The Skamton (also first named) Update

this update's been a LONG time coming. like, half a year's worth of "long time coming."
changes include...

- changing my youtube and tumblr links to buttons with the sites' icons on them, and adding a soundcloud button (also adding links to my site on those platforms)
- skamton's finally (mostly) done with... whatever the hell he's been doing. begrudgingly, i am allowing him to stay and host whatever incomprehensible garbage he wants on my site.
the link to his part of the site will be available as one of the ads on silver's website
- updating the 404 page to use trap team's portal screen and also be much more functional with different window sizes
the text is now part of the image itself instead of being actual text on the page
- retroactively naming all the updates on this page

skamton's site features five pages, many more secrets and entire secret pages, the old version of the 404 (slightly broken), and not actually much more.
well, no, there's a wolfdragon245 cameo on it. that phrasing is a bit misleading actually
most of the spots for advertisements on skamton's main page don't actually have anything yet, but otherwise it should be fully functional. fingers crossed. skamton's fingers, that is.</pre>

(unreleased update, changes included in next update)

buttons are clicky now.
also, the title of my 404 page was wrong and somehow despite all the issue fixing i had to do LAST update i STILL missed that.
made the background darker to make looking at it sear your eyes less</pre>

The Skylanders Button Update

everything's finally CENTERED !!!!
buttons are colored like my helmet now and also there's a skylanders button. you should press it.
also added some links to me, and...

i feel activity from Skamton.
probably best that you don't go inspecting every little nook and cranny to try and find him yet. but, i suppose i can't stop you.

oh, and there's a 404 page now.</pre>
